No word yet on whether authorities suspect foul play, but..." You switch off the holotank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION412;And let's hope they never do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION420;You open and close your hand. This shouldn't be complicated. It's YOUR hand. The images grow sharper, clearer, but you push them aside. There's an alien presence in your thoughts, but you shut it out. The gates of your mind slam shut. The presence recedes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION420;What WAS that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION421;[GetBrainjackHackerDesc][GetBrainjackHackerDescSchizophrenic] Unfortunately, once you're inside, your good luck runs out. It's as if everywhere you turn, you see a gate slam shut. [target_victim.GetSheHeCap] is two steps ahead of you, keeping you locked out. Finally, you give up. [target_victim.GetHerHisCap] mind is an impenetrable forrtress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION421;Damnit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION422;Unfortunately, you do not wake up to news of [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s death, but rather to a report from [From.GetCrisisBestName] - [From.GetSheHe] wasn't able to penetrate [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s mental defenses after all. The plan was a failure, although fortunately nothing went catastrophically wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION422;We'll get [target_victim.GetHerHim] next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION430;You concentrate. This is your mind. Your domain. You will make this intruder regret trespassing. You turn your full attention on the presence, shine the lights of your mind on them. [GetBrainjackFeedbackVictimDesc];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
String_brainjack_feedback_no_result;The presence is still obscured, but it reels back in pain and shock in the face of your aggression. You drive it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAASSASSINATION430;BEGONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION431;[GetBrainjackHackerDesc][GetBrainjackHackerDescSchizophrenic] Unfortunately, once you're inside, your good luck runs out, as [crisis_target.GetSheHe] retaliates against you with vicious force. Your mind reels and your head spins as you're shoved violently backed into your own skull - but not before seeing you very, very clearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION431;Argh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION432;Unfortunately, you do not wake up to news of [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s death, but rather to a report from [From.GetCrisisBestName] - [From.GetSheHe] wasn't able to penetrate [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s mental defenses after all. The plan was a catastrophic failure, and may even have exposed your plot entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCASSASSINATION450;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: [From.PlotTarget.GetFullName]\n[From.PlotTarget.GetFullName] believes that [From.GetSheHe] is safe, but [From.PlotTarget.GetSheHe] has left us a backdoor into [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] own mind - a Direct Neural Interface. I want you to hack [From.PlotTarget.GetHerHis] DNI and force [From.PlotTarget.GerHerHim] to commit suicide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION455;TO: [Root.GetFullName]\nFROM: [From.GetFullName]\nRE: [Root.PlotTarget.GetFullName]\nI'm sorry, but this is simply too dangerous. My part in this scheme is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION500;Sometimes the simplest approach is the best one. You already know the details of [target_victim.GetCrisisBestName]'s security arrangements. You're already in position to strike. Why bother with the middleman when you could just shoot [t.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION500;Fine, I'll do it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION500;I'll see what [target_mastermind.GetCrisisInformalName] thinks of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCASSASSINATION500;No, it's too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION501;TO: [Root.GetCrisisFormalName]\nFROM: [From.GetCrisisFormalName]\nRE: [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]\nI've acquired the details of [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s security arrangements, and I'm in position to make a move. I can get close to [target_victim.GetHerHim] and shoot [target_victim.GetHerHim] before [target_victim.GetSheHe] even knows what's coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION501;An acceptable plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION501;Too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION502;TO: [Root.GetCrisisFormalName]\nFROM: [From.GetCrisisFormalName]\nRE: Your Proposal\nI've reviwed the details of your plan, and I approve. Make your move as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCASSASSINATION503;TO: [Root.GetCrisisFormalName]\nFROM: [From.GetCrisisFormalName]\nRE: Your Proposal\nI can't agree to this. There's too much risk that you could be captured or killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION503;I guess we'll need a new plan, then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCASSASSINATION510;It's a late night. You're [GetLateNightActivity], when you hear a noise. You freeze and look around, but see nothing. You turn your attention back to what you were doing.\n\nThe last thing you hear is a gunshot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAASSASSINATION510;...what...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION511;You penetrate [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s security with contemptuous ease, and manage to find [target_victim.GetHerHim] completely alone and undefended. There's a brief scare when you accidentally make a noise, but [target_victim.GetSheHe] dismisses it and returns to what [target_victim.GetSheHe] was doing.\n\nIt's the last mistake [target_victim.GetSheHe] ever makes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION511;Now to make my escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION512;The job is done. [From.GetCrisisInformalName] penetrated [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s security with ease, managed to get [target_victim.GetHerHim] alone, and shot [target_victim.GetHerHim]. [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName] is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION512;Mission accomplished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION513;You're awakened in the middle of the night by an emergency alert. There's been an incident. You wait patiently as an aide explains to you that [From.GetCrisisInformalName], your [GetFromRelation], has been shot dead. There are no leads on the identity of the murderer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPASSASSINATION520;fights back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION520;It's a late night. You're [GetLateNightActivity], when the alarm suddenly goes off. There's an intruder. Before you can react, the door hisses open, and a ]From.GetManWoman] bursts into the room with a gun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION520;Defend yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION521;You thought the infiltration was going smoothly, until the alarm went off. Damn. Someone must have spotted you. Still, you're close enough to [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName] to finish the mission. You burst into [target_victim.GetHerHis] room with weapon in hand, just as [target_victim.GetSheHe] looks up at the door.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION521;Time to finish you off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION522;You let out a sigh of relief. [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName] is dead. It took a bit, but [target_victim.GetSheHe]'s dead. Now you just need to get the hell out of here before security arrives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION522;Time to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION523;[From.GetCrisisInformalName] reports mixed results. [From.GetSheHeCap] was able to kill [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName], but [From.GetSheHe] was spotted by security forces. They may be able to trace the assassination back to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION523;Damnit, [From.GetCrisisInformalName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBASSASSINATION524;[target_mastermind.GetCrisisInformalName] isn't going to like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION525;Disaster! Not only did [From.GetCrisisInformalName] fail to kill [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName], but the idiot even managed to [From.GetHowBadTheAssassinationWent]. It's only a matter of time before this is traced back to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION525;You've got to be kidding me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION526;You flee through the halls, the assassin hot on your heels, before finally managing to reach the security office There are only a few officers on duty, but all them have been alerted by the alarm. You're able to breathe a sigh of relief as they take charge of the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, despite a thorough search, they are unable to capture the assassin. Still, you now have a pretty good idea who was behind this attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION526;I can't believe that just happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION527;You let out a sigh of relief as security finally arrives. You've successfully defended yourself, and you're still alive. Still, you can't help but feel rattled that this happened at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION527;That was so close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION528;You stand over the corpse, hyperventilating. You're still not sure that what just happened was real. You barely recognize that security has arrived, or that they're spreading out to see if the assassin had any accomplices. This [target_assassin.GetManWoman] was trying to kill you, but you killed [target_assassin.GetHerHim] instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION528;That was so close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPASSASSINATION529;was behind this assassination attempt, according to your intelligence officers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION529;This is an absolute catastrophe. Not only did [target_assassin.GetCrisisInformalName] fail to kill [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName], but [target_assassin.GetSheHe] managed to get [target_assassin.GetHerselfHimself] killed, and security has already traced the attack back to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION529;Damnit, damnit, damnit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPASSASSINATION530;You fail to penetrate [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName]'s security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION530;It's no use. Despite your best efforts, the security surrounding [target_victim.GetCrisisInformalName] is simply too tight. If you tried to make a move, you'd almost certainly be captured. You'll just have to find another way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION531;Back to the drawing board.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION531;[target_mastermind.GetCrisisInformalName] won't be happy about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION532;TO: [Root.GetCrisisFormalName]\nFROM: [From.GetCrisisFormalName]\nRE: Our plans\nUnfortunately, I'm going to have to call the operation off. Security is too tight, I'd never be able to get the package alone. We'll have to come up with another plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCASSASSINATION540;You're awakened in the middle of the night by a blaring alarm and an armed security team bursting into your quarters, shouting something about an intruder. After the alarm finally ends, your head of security informs you that they've managed to capture the intruder, who was heavily armed and apparently planned on taking your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION540;Can I get back to sleep now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCASSASSINATION541;You've made a huge mistake. You set off the alarm almost immediately, and it's mere minutes before security manages to arrive. They have you badly outnumbered and surrounded. There's no hope of escape. You're forced to drop your weapoon and get down on your knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAASSASSINATION541;Well, this could have gone better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBASSASSINATION541;[target_mastermind.GetCrisisInformalName] isn't going to be happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
